## Description
This README Generator is powered by Node.js, JavaScript, jQuery and dynamic HTML. This project will allow users to quickly create a README. I enjoyed creating this project as I learned alot more about Node.js and using packages such as NPM. It was challenging to write this without having the console window of the browswer. I was able to leverage my JavaScript acknowledge to execute this project. I learned alot more on READMEs as well. In future versions, I would like to increase the license and make the generator more customizable.
